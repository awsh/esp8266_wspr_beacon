# ESP8266 WSPR Beacon

This is the code for my ESP8266 based WSPR beacon that was inspired by [Charlie Morris' (ZL2CTM) beacon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfJd6Lmjy9g).

You will need to update the SSID and PASS variables in the sketch with your wifi network info. 

You will also need to generate your encoded WSPR message using the included wsprgen program.
